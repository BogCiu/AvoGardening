# AvoGardening
Arduino code for the automatic maintenance and monitoring of a plant 
("Avo" because i built this specifically for an Avocado tree)

Components used:

Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2

Soil humidity sensor            - YL-69 + YL-38  
Light sensor                    - A simple 5528 LDR  
Air temperature/humidity sensor - DHT11  
Real Time Clock Module          - DS1302 MH-Real Time Clock Modules 2  
Water level sensor              - Water level sensor (no, really, that's the most technical name i found for it)  
Pumps                           - 2 * Peristaltic 12V Pumps model "G328" from Grothen (and 12V power supply sources for them)  
Relays                          - HL-58S V1.2 (this has 8 relays but the project only uses 3)  
Ventilator                      - 5V fan/ventilator motor (+ 5v supply for it)  

# Wire connections and sensor placement
--To be detailed in the future, but wire connections can be infered from pins described in the code, sensor placement is mostly common sens, water level sensor goes in water collection bowl of the plant pot, everything else wherever you think is right--

# Website connection and operation
--To be detailed in the future--
